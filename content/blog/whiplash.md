I'm very grateful to have so many friends, family, and dear people across the US, and the world. This is the first, of hopefully many, installments serving as an update/forum/?? to communicate with all of you.

To summarize these past four weeks: whiplash.

## Germany

In October, I traveled to Berlin with my friend, Hope, spontaneously booked when I found $400 round-trip flights. I stayed behind an extra week to work remotely/explore East Germany. In Berlin, we immersed ourselves in history — shout-out to Rick Steve's free walking tour audio guide — visiting sites that highlighted the city's past while enjoying plenty of good food and drink. 

I love listening to music in the language/country I'm traveling to — my preference on this trip was Scorpions, and Die Artze. For the following week, after Hope left, I traveled to Leipzig and Dresden. I credit the 10 years I spent learning classical music, but I love traveling to historical music sites, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that I *had* to go to Leipzig to see Bach, Mendelssohn, Grieg, and the Schumanns. The true highlight, however, was the church in Leipzig where Leibniz (yes, that calculus guy) was baptized.

What I took away from my trip to Germany was (1) the eerie parallels between East German propaganda and certain trends in media manipulation today. (2) pumpkin cinnamon rolls are delicious, (3) I've really got this travel + remote work routine down.

## Career Update

In early November, on the 2 year annivesary of when I got laid off from Twitter, I got laid off. Again.

What made things different this time was greater personal & financial stability and preparedness, reaffirming that I can adapt, I am proactive, and I will always get back up.
 
I had been passed up for a promotion, so, fueled by frustration, I seriously started job hunting in late September. I'm grateful that I got an offer from Hashicorp, a company specializing in infrastructure automation, the day after the layoff.

## Japan

But anyway, this whiplash of this unexpected career transition changed my plans drastically for November. I intended to spend 9 days in Japan for 9-10 days, and return to Idaho for Thanksgiving. Now, with no immediate obligations until December, I decided to extend my trip. Posing this to my family as a "once-in-a-lifetime trip", I compromised to spend more time in Idaho in December and booked a new return flight from Seoul. 

Japan had been on my mind for months, especially the challenge of solo travel in such a unique culture where I couldn't depend on knowing the language. It turns out New York City prepared me well — navigating the bullet trains and Tokyo’s subways felt almost familiar. Still, I got lost quite frequently trying to exit the Shinjuku station.

Over 10 days, I explored Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Hakone, and Tokyo. I saw countless temples, ate so much sushi, and walked an average of 25-30,000 steps & 20 flights of stairs a day. Despite only getting 4-5 hours of sleep a night (jet lag), I felt energized and excited to explore everything in Japan I could.

Some favorite moments:
- **Food**: Japanese BBQ and sushi in Osaka were incredible, and I’ll never forget the chicken and sardine ramen in Tokyo.
  - **Vending Machines**: Japan has tons of vending machines, but I was most surprised & happy to see a vending machine for my favorite drink — freshly squeezed orange juice — for ~4 USD. Delicious & so easy!
- **Friends**: Unexpectedly, catching up with a high school friend in Tokyo's Asakusa district & racing to catch the last train of the night — we'll get the choco-banana gyoza next time!
- **Onsens**: I spent one night in a traditional Japanase ryokan in Hakone, a hot spring town outside of Tokyo. I was treated to full Japanese hospitality & enjoyed a beautifully landscaped public hot spring (onsen) under colorful fall foliage. 
- **Jpop Concert**: Booking a unique Airbnb experience, I attended a Jpop idol concert featuring Aiika, a band of three 20-something women backed by a rock band. The audience was like 98% middle-aged male fans (otakus), lining up for meet-and-greet Polaroids (*cheki*) with the performers afterward. After the show, I joined the guide at an izakaya (Japanese pub) filled with drunk, happy businessmen. I even tried chicken sashimi, which tasted more vinegary than anything else!

To my family & friends in NYC, I'm bringing back like 10 different flavors of KitKats from Japan, and I can't eat them all myself.

## What's Next

I’m currently working on getting this site up and running, so updates on my upcoming stops in Thailand and South Korea will likely have to wait until I’m back in NYC.

This layoff, while challenging, reminded me of the importance of staying connected with the people I care about. I’m hoping this blog can serve as a way to share stories and keep in touch without relying on traditional social media.
